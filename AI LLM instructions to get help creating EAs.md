### 1  Project Goal

Create census **enumeration areas (EAs)** from ~ 46 000 building-footprint points in Haiti (Les Cayes, Torbeck, Aken).
 *Each EA must contain contain **375** building points +/- 15 **==OR==** **750** building points +/- 15 (no values in between).*

### 4  Outstanding Needs / Next Tasks

1. **Help deciding what approach to go with and establish an ideal workflow process for creating enumeration areas that all contain either 375 points +/- 15 or 750 +/- 15.**
   1. The ideal workflow will:
      1. Likely take into consideration the point density of the dataset being used
      2. Create enumeration areas based on the proximity and quantity of points
      3. The geometric shape of the enumeration areas will be fairly simple
2. **Batch automation** – ArcPy script or ModelBuilder chain covering the step required for creating the enumeration areas

### 5 **Specific Technical Requirements:**

The critical constraint that emerged during my work is that enumeration areas must contain **375** building points +/- 15 **==OR==** **750** building points +/- 15.

### 6  Software Environment

- ArcGIS Pro 3.x
- Spatial Statistics extension available
- Python window inside Pro (ArcPy) is okay
- File paths use Windows syntax (e.g., `G:\ADF Haiti\…`)

------

### 7  Help Request 

*Use the information from the other AI/LMM to help me from my last state of progress and help me create appropriate EA layers

Priorities:

1. Provide explicit ArcGIS Pro step by step guidance and tool settings **or** ArcPy code to implement a solution
2. Recommend any new approaches and workflows or recommend using an previously attempted workflow that includes changes and tweaks to meet the needs.
3. Offer an end-to-end script or ModelBuilder outline if possible.

Feel free to ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear.
